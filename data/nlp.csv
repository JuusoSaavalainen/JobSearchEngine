"IPRally","ML Engineer","Entry level","Are you up for the toughest AI challenges around graph neural networks? We have built a graph-based patent search engine with which our users find the documents that already contain their concepts. We are looking for an Machine Learning Engineer who can envision breakthrough-level ideas and follow them through with software engineering excellence. You will be working with the very core of the product - the search algorithm.We have converted 100M patent documents into 100M knowledge graphs, to compress the key information into simpler data for ML. It has been possible because of the semi-structured patent text. Patent documents also contain rich metadata like citations between documents, which are essentially labels for supervised training. All of this presents an opportunity to dive deeper into text understanding than even the LLMs from the tech giants.The current model we use is the Graph Transformer (read our blog about the graph transformer), so both the NLP transformers and the GNN models are relevant. We published a paper at the SIGIR 2023 conference about our general approach (read our paper).The daily work is done in a small hybrid team. Remote work is okay, but we expect to see each other at least once a quarter in person. There is also a separate team providing MLOps support.Technology stackPyTorch for search model developmentML services deployed as Python microservicesGoogle Cloud for computationRequirementsExcellence in applied deep learning, ideally also with GNNsA genuine eagerness to learnKnowledge about NLPStrong social skillsFluency in English, which is our company languageYou are located ideally in Finland, but at least you can work in European time zonesBenefitsA rare opportunity to join an early-stage, disruptive company that has a unique edge, ambitious plans, and an already proven record of success in a growing $2bn industryOpportunities to grow as we grow. We will help you be the best you can be in this role, and help you develop skills that will help you reach the next stage.

You can share your Github profile with us or do a code task if thatâ€™s what you preferA technical interview with Sebastian and an AI team member to dig deeper into your technical skillsA final call with our CTO JuhoSounds interesting? Send us an application now!About IPRallyIPRally will change the way of finding and categorizing patents. How? We have introduced transparent and reliable AI applications to the patent search, analysis, and classification process, which helps our customers save a lot of time, resources, and money. We are transforming the complex and tedious process of finding information that is crucial for our customers, but most importantly, we help innovative companies quickly find and act upon opportunities and drastically reduce risk.So, who are we? IPRally was founded in Helsinki, Finland in 2018. With a vision to automate tasks that steal resources from both inventors and patent professionals and help them achieve their goals faster, a completely new and ground-breaking way of searching for technical information was built. By modeling the technical content of patents, and processing this with cutting-edge, proprietary graph neural networks, IPRally gives customers highly relevant information at their fingertips, in seconds.","https://fi.linkedin.com/jobs/view/ml-engineer-at-iprally-3731373665"
