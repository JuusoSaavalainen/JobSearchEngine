Target Vision Oy - Executive Search & Recruitment Tailor Made Solutions in Finland and International,SW Developer,Entry level,"We are looking for a Machine Learning SW expert to improve our deployment from Python to mobile runtime stream. This work focuses on exporting the developed ML models from Python development environment to our mobile runtime environment (C++). There are two main areas of focus, model export to mobile format and then mobile ML model execution on device. This requires compilation and integration into our software product’s runtime environment.The work includes evaluation of ARM NN SDK (C++) features regarding Onnx and TFLite support and limitations as well as performance evaluation on converted models. A study on the workload for runtime conversion of PyTorch in Android AOSP environment is needed. Also, the work effort required for maintenance (version updates) and dependency identification is part of this work. An important part of the work consists of integrating ARM NN SDK into our existing C++ implemented solution. This includes changes required to make our SW product’s SDK API and its compilation and testing with our ML models suitable. The goal is to ensure modest workload for version updates with automation of testing and compilation, especially in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) project.The most important part of the work is PyTorch -> mobile conversion and runtime environment design and implementation. The current implementation flow from TensorFlow to TFLite model in TFLite runtime is to be changed to a flow from PyTorch to mobile optimized model. This work includes selection of suitable format at Python level (e.g. Onnx, TFLite, PyTorch mobile optimized) as well as evaluation and creation of conversion path from PyTorch to target format. There are several options, each with different constraints related to e.g. quality or predictable execution speed. Also, model optimization, such as quantization, is needed as part of the conversion flow. Compilation and integration against our SW product’s SDK API and testing with our ML models is to be done to verify the conversion.The recommended locations are Tampere or Espoo. The assumption is that most of the work can be done remotely, but network access requires a laptop managed by the client. We will provide the devices required for the work.We estimate that a skilled expert could complete this work by the end of 2023, if the start would be in August.After successful completion of this project, there may be new needs for a possible follow-up project.Skills and qualifications required Strong practical experience in Maching Learning development workflow Deep understanding of Onnx, TFLite and PyTorch ML development environments Good understanding of common DNN models model architecture and their parameters in each target ML development environment Excellent C++ SW development skills Understanding of Android AOSP Build engineering skills (CMake, Soong/Bazel for AOSP) Experience with ARM NN SDK Experience in implementing and testing ML-based solutions on ARM with Android OS and HW device Very good general software development skills with experience in using GitLab/GitHub and CI/CD",https://fi.linkedin.com/jobs/view/sw-developer-at-target-vision-oy-executive-search-recruitment-tailor-made-solutions-in-finland-and-international-3699967326

          Full-time","Tunnin juna on Helsingin ja Turun välille suunnitteilla oleva nopea kaksiraiteinen junayhteys, joka lyhentää kaupunkien välistä matka-aikaa, tuo uusia mahdollisuuksia kasvuun ja luo edellytyksiä myös lähiliikenteen kehittämiselle. Turun Tunnin Juna Oy vastaa ratasuunnitelmien laatimisesta uuden radan rakentamisvalmiuteen saakka. Tervetuloa osaksi ainutlaatuista projektia ja meidän tarinaa! Haemme PROJEKTI-INSINÖÖRIÄ monipuoliseen tehtävään, joka pitää sisällään muun muassa hankinta-asioita, projektinhallintaa ja raportointia sekä kehitystehtäviä. Tämä tehtävä saattaisi sopia sinulle, jos  koet rautatiealan muuttuvan toimintaympäristön sekä uusien käytäntöjen ja kulttuurin kehittämisen mielenkiintoiseksi ja innostavaksi sinulla on tekninen koulutus ja vahvaa rautatiealan osaamista olet toiminut projektityyppisessä toimintaympäristössä ja koet sen itsellesi luontevaksi   Mistä projekti-insinööri vastaa? Projekti-insinöörinä tulet työskentelemään tiiviisti yhteistyössä hankkeen projektinjohtajan kanssa osallistuen muun muassa hankintoihin, projektinhallintaan ja sen kehittämiseen. Tavoitteenasi on tutustua hankkeen kokonaisuuteen ja kehittää muun muassa projektinhallintaa vastaamaan tulevaisuuden tarpeisiin parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla projektin edetessä. Tulet osallistumaan myös erilaisiin sidosryhmien kanssa järjestettäviin tapahtumiin ja tilaisuuksiin. Ensimmäisenä tulet tutustumaan hankkeen nykytilaan, keskeisiin sidosryhmiin ja toimintaympäristöön sekä perehtymään julkisten hankintojen malliin sekä tuleviin tarpeisiimme hankintojen osalta.  Mitä tarjoamme sinulle? Pääset mukaan jättämään kädenjälkesi ainutlaatuiseen, yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävään hankkeeseen, joka edistää paikallista kehitystä ja jokaisen kansalaisen mahdollisuutta liikkua. Vastuullisuus on meille merkittävä tekijä, ja vastuullisuusperiaatteisiimme ja raporttiimme voit tutustua täällä.  Projekti-insinöörinä olet tärkeä osa lämminhenkistä ja tiiviisti yhteen hiileen puhaltavaa työyhteisöämme. Kulttuurimme on mutkaton ja avoin. Olemme pieni mutta aikaansaava joukko: loppuvuoteen mennessä nuppilukumme tulee olemaan kahdeksan, ja ensi vuoden loppuun mennessä tavoitteena on vähintään tuplata tuo luku. Oman ydinjoukkomme lisäksi teemme päivittäin yhteistyötä lukuisten sidosryhmien, esimerkiksi erilaisten suunnittelutoimistojen ja kuntien kanssa. Projekti-insinöörinä tärkeimmät sidosryhmäsi ovat hankealueen kunnat ja kaupungit, väylävirasto sekä suunnittelutoimistot.   Toimistomme sijaitsee loistavien kulkuyhteyksien varrella Espoon Matinkylässä, kauppakeskus Iso Omenan kupeessa.

Muutamaa seikkaa haluamme kuitenkin jokaisen työntekijämme osalta korostaa: Oma-aloitteinen työskentelytapa on organisaatiossamme hyvin luontaista. Tartumme asioihin proaktiivisesti huomatessasi tekemisen paikan. Koska olemme pieni organisaatio, autamme mielellämme toisiamme ja olemme valmiita tekemään sellaisiakin asioita, jotka eivät välttämättä ole meille ennalta tuttuja. Toivomme tällaista ennakkoluulottomuutta ja joustovaraa myös sinulta.  Projektiympäristö edellyttää kykyä sietää ajoittain epävarmojakin paikkoja ja saada asioita aikaan epävarmuudesta huolimatta.  Näiden lisäksi toivomme sinulta ennen muuta seuraavia: vähintään muutaman vuoden kokemusta teknisestä roolista mielellään rautatiealalla julkisten hankintojen tuntemusta  hyviä vuorovaikutustaitoja sekä paineensietokykyä Näin saat lisätietoja ja haet tehtävää Heräsikö kiinnostus? Hienoa! Tehtävään hakeminen on helppoa ja nopeaa: voit jättää CV:n tai linkin LinkedIn-profiiliisi ja vastata muutamaan osaamiseesi ja tehtävään liittyvään kysymykseen. Ilmoitathan kiinnostuksestasi viimeistään 13.10. Jos kaipaat vielä lisätietoja, vastaamme mielellämme kysymyksiisi!
