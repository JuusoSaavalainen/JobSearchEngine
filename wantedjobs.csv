"Target Vision Oy - Executive Search & Recruitment Tailor Made Solutions in Finland and International","SW Developer","Entry level","We are looking for a Machine Learning SW expert to improve our deployment from Python to mobile runtime stream. This work focuses on exporting the developed ML models from Python development environment to our mobile runtime environment (C++). There are two main areas of focus, model export to mobile format and then mobile ML model execution on device. This requires compilation and integration into our software product’s runtime environment.The work includes evaluation of ARM NN SDK (C++) features regarding Onnx and TFLite support and limitations as well as performance evaluation on converted models. A study on the workload for runtime conversion of PyTorch in Android AOSP environment is needed. Also, the work effort required for maintenance (version updates) and dependency identification is part of this work. An important part of the work consists of integrating ARM NN SDK into our existing C++ implemented solution. This includes changes required to make our SW product’s SDK API and its compilation and testing with our ML models suitable. The goal is to ensure modest workload for version updates with automation of testing and compilation, especially in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) project.The most important part of the work is PyTorch -> mobile conversion and runtime environment design and implementation. The current implementation flow from TensorFlow to TFLite model in TFLite runtime is to be changed to a flow from PyTorch to mobile optimized model. This work includes selection of suitable format at Python level (e.g. Onnx, TFLite, PyTorch mobile optimized) as well as evaluation and creation of conversion path from PyTorch to target format. There are several options, each with different constraints related to e.g. quality or predictable execution speed. Also, model optimization, such as quantization, is needed as part of the conversion flow. Compilation and integration against our SW product’s SDK API and testing with our ML models is to be done to verify the conversion.The recommended locations are Tampere or Espoo. The assumption is that most of the work can be done remotely, but network access requires a laptop managed by the client. We will provide the devices required for the work.We estimate that a skilled expert could complete this work by the end of 2023, if the start would be in August.After successful completion of this project, there may be new needs for a possible follow-up project.Skills and qualifications required Strong practical experience in Maching Learning development workflow Deep understanding of Onnx, TFLite and PyTorch ML development environments Good understanding of common DNN models model architecture and their parameters in each target ML development environment Excellent C++ SW development skills Understanding of Android AOSP Build engineering skills (CMake, Soong/Bazel for AOSP) Experience with ARM NN SDK Experience in implementing and testing ML-based solutions on ARM with Android OS and HW device Very good general software development skills with experience in using GitLab/GitHub and CI/CD","https://fi.linkedin.com/jobs/view/sw-developer-at-target-vision-oy-executive-search-recruitment-tailor-made-solutions-in-finland-and-international-3699967326"

"Not Bad Security","Microsoft 365-alustapalveluiden tietoturva-asiantuntija","Employment type
        

          Full-time","Not Bad Security Oy on alkuvuodesta 2022 perustettu Microsoft-tietoturvaan keskittyvä asiantuntijayritys. Vaikka yritys ottaakin vasta ensimmäisiä askeleitaan, olemme jo melko kokeneita alan konkareita. Toimimme haastavissa projekti- ja neuvonantorooleissa, tavoitteenamme rakentaa maailman turvallisimmat pilvi- ja hybridiratkaisut asiakkaillemme. Yrityksemme on työntekijöidensä omistama.Haluamme sinut, Microsoft 365-alustapalveluiden tietoturva-asiantuntija!Aikuisten oikeasti haluamme palkata seuraavan multi-talentin meille töihin. Täysipäiväinen työsuhde, 100% remote, ja fokuksessa supervahvasti Microsoft 365:n tietoturva ja sen liitännäiset alustapalvelut (Entra ID, Microsoft 365 Defender-jutut).Toimimme asiakkaidemme kanssa tiiviissä rajapinnassa projekteissa ja hankkeissa. Reagoimme myös mm. tietomurtoihin äkkipikaa, joskaan tällä hetkellä emme tarjoa esimerkiksi ympärivuorokautista päivystyspalvelua.Ihan absoluuttisesti tärkeimmät asiat ensinTyötä voi tehdä mistä vain. Meillä ei ole omaa toimistoa, joskin tarvittaessa työpöytää, rauhaa ja kahvia löydämme sisaryrityksemme toimistolta Helsingin keskustasta. On siellä joitain hahmoja paikallakin, jos haluaa chattailla sen watercoolerin äärellä. Työajat kuten itse parhaaksi näet – joskin asiakkaat tuppaavat arvostamaan, kun suunnilleen klo 09-15 välillä olisi elävien kirjoissa ja työntäisi bittiä pilveen. Suurin osa asiakkaistamme arvostaa, että kykenemme työskentelemään sekä suomeksi että englanniksi. Yritettiin ruotsiksi men det gick inte så bra.Työnkuva on moninainen, kuten pienissä yrityksissä aina. Seuraavassa ""must hävit"" – karkeasti tällaisten asioiden kanssa teemme töitä asiakkaiden kanssa:Ydinteknologiat ovat Microsoft 365:n alustapalvelut. Isommassa kontekstissa alustapalvelut: tunnistautuminen, Defender for Cloud Appsin ja Microsoft 365 Defenderin viilaaminen, kokonaisvaltainen tenantin haltuunotto, Exchange Onlinen tietoturvallistaminen, Entra ID:n kyvykkyyksien huomiointi, troubleshoottaus ja debuggaus, jne. Yksin ei tarvitse selviytyä, teamwork makes the dream work!Aivan absoluuttisesti kovassa ytimessä myös päätelaitehallinta: Intune, Microsoft Secure Score, Vulnerability-judanssit, KQL-kyselyt syvään päähän, uusien preview-featureiden koeponnistaminen ja labrailu. Myös hybridiarkkitehtuurit (ei ADFS-deploymentteja enää herran vuonna 2023) tulee vastaan joka viikko. Mukana menossa myös Entra ID, Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, PAW, PKI, Entra ID Legacy Controller (kuten ammattikielellä tupataan sanoa).Suoritamme itsekin sertifiointitestejä, kun ne fiksuilta näyttävät ja tuntuvat. MS-102/MD-102/SC-100/SC-200/SC-300/SC-400 ovat peruskauraa, mutta eivät toki mikään itseisarvo. Kiva, jos niitä jaksaa joskus tehdä.Työ on paljon itsenäistä asiantuntijuuden toimittamista, mutta myös tiimityötä – sekä omien työkavereiden kanssa, että asiakkaan asiantuntijaorganisaation kanssa. Pystyt tarvittaessa liidaamaan yksin tiimejä ja asiantuntijoita hankkeissa. Aika monta juttua hoidellaan Teamsin kautta, toisaalta käydään myös asiakkailla paikan päällä. Myös vis-a-vis, old school-puhelimella ja sähköpostilla.Olet löytänyt sisäisen projektipäällikkösi, ja sinulla pysyy hanskassa omat - ja joskus vähän muidenkin - aikataulut, ja luvatut asiat.Sitten, hei, sellainen juttu myös - me teemme työmääräarvioita. Annamme estimaatteja, pohdimme toteutustapoja ja sparraamme asiakkaiden kanssa yhtenään. Kysymyksiä projekteissa, jotka eivät ole nevahööd tässä roolissa:""Pitäisi provisioida Entra ID:hen tunnareita HR-järjestelmästä, ja säätää niihin sopivat M365-lisenssit automaattisesti - minkälainen ratkaisu, ja millainen työmäärä?""""Miten hei, jos otetaan Microsoft 365 Copilot käyttöön, onko privacyn osalta jotain mitä voidaan huomioida? Miten voidaan valvoa mitä dataa LLM-mallin indeksiin menee?""""Onko keinoa säätää kaikkiin työasemiin lokaali-adminin passut keskitetysti? Ja jatkossa kaikki Administrators-ryhmän tunnarien passut kans? Ja raportti näistä joka kuukausi Teams-viestinä.""Eikä näihin tietysti vastauksia kylmiltään tarvitse löytyä, mutta omistajuuden otto, ja ratkaisun pohdinta ja toteutuksen liidaaminen maaliin on tässäkin supervoima.Palkka ja bonukset 💰Maksamme mielellämme palkkaa hyvästä työstä. Otamme mielellämme palkkatoiveita ja pyyntöjä vastaan. Olemme sisäisesti tästä roolista pohtineet asialliseksi korvaukseksi jotain väliltä 4500-6 500 eur/kk. Riippuu paljon kokemuksesta, yrittäjähenkisyydestä, ja kyvyistä esimerkiksi draivata projekteja maaliin onnistuneesti.Ideaalisti pyrkisimme jonkinlaiseen onnistumismalliin – kun projekti menee erityisen hyvin, mielellämme bonustelemme siitä suoraan tekijälle mannaa. Täydet lomat tottakai, ei kai kukaan niitä enää halua nollata.Edut ja työvälineetKaikki fiksut työvälineet mitä tarvitset. Työterveys. Ei turhaa niuhottamista tai mikromanageerausta. Itsenäiden ote, mutta osana tiivistä tiimiä. Asiallista menoa, reipasta läppää, eikä töitä tehdä iltaisin tai viikonloppuisin – ellei nyt jostain syystä oma flow-tila ole silloin optimaalinen. Ilmaiset Microsoft-sertifioinnit ja koulutukset. Mahdollisuus vaikuttaa suoraan yrityksen tulokseen, kehitykseen ja kehittymissuuntaan. 100% etätyö, tai jotain 0-100% väliltä. Miten elämäntilanteeseen sopii. Kvartaaleittain gettogethereita, johon tuut jos sulla on aikaa. Lounasetu (Edenred).Työvälineet: Premium-läppäri - 75% meidän läppäreistä on MacBookeja M2-prossulla, mutta Windows täysin OK myös. Erityisen hyvä puhelin ja ripeä 5G. Iso näyttö ja hyvä näppis. Docking-station. Hyvä headsetti.Tule tekemään töitä kanssamme!LinkedIn-profiili kertoo jo paljon, ja se olisi kiva vilkaista. Kerro meille toiveistasi, urasuunnitelmista, tahtotilastasi, ja mikä on sun supervoima.”En enää ikinä halua avata Yammeria” on jo voimakkaasti sanottu, ja se on ihan ok. Olemme valmiit etenemään rauhassa, ripeästi tai jotain siltä väliltä.Meillä on töissä yksi Microsoft MVP, aika monella on MCT, ja liuta muita Microsoft-tutkintoja - kaikilla vähintään 15 vuotta diippiä osaamista. Tule oppimaan, ja jakamaan osaamistasi myös meille!JutellaanPistä sähköpostia hello@notbadsecurity.com tai laita Linkedinissä viesti @Jussi Roine.""It's better to be a pirate than join the navy."" –Steve Jobs","https://fi.linkedin.com/jobs/view/microsoft-365-alustapalveluiden-tietoturva-asiantuntija-at-not-bad-security-3725445227"
