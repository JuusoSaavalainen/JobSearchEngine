We are looking for an Machine Learning Engineer who can envision breakthrough-level ideas and follow them through with software engineering excellence. You will be working with the very core of the product - the search algorithm.We have converted 100M patent documents into 100M knowledge graphs, to compress the key information into simpler data for ML. It has been possible because of the semi-structured patent text. Patent documents also contain rich metadata like citations between documents, which are essentially labels for supervised training. All of this presents an opportunity to dive deeper into text understanding than even the LLMs from the tech giants.The current model we use is the Graph Transformer (read our blog about the graph transformer), so both the NLP transformers and the GNN models are relevant. We published a paper at the SIGIR 2023 conference about our general approach (read our paper).The daily work is done in a small hybrid team. Remote work is okay, but we expect to see each other at least once a quarter in person.
