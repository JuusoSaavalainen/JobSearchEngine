# Job Search Engine
Detailed description of this project can be found here: __

We provide demo app hosted with streamlit here: __

For legal and privacy reason that can be found

we did not want to host webapp that uses any scraping.

We decided to host demo app that simulates the scraping with static data but otherwise behaves similarry.

If you want to use the scraper to get the realtime joblisting you can do it by running version that includes the scraper locally at your own risk.

## How to run the app locally with scraper
